            <h1>Biography</h1>
            <p>I'm a games/software developer with primary experience in TypeScript/JavaScript/HTML5, but have had experience in a number of other languages (such as C/C++, C#, and Lua). I take great pride in my professional and personal projects; placing a great deal of effort into them all. I speak Japanese, am learning to play guitar, and of course I play a lot of games!</p>
            <p>I graduated from Bournemouth University in 2019 with a first-class w/ honours in Games Programming.</p>
            <p>Currently working for Popcore GmbH in Berlin, Germany as a Principal HTML5 Game Developer, porting mobile Unity games to HTML5 platforms such as Facebook Instant.</p>
