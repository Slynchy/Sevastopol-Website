# Sevastopol-Website

A recreation of Alien Isolation's computer terminals aboard the Sevastopol, made in TypeScript using PIXIv6 and [tsthree](https://github.com/Slynchy/tsthree).

Repo is pre-configured for [my portfolio website](https://slynch.dev/).

## How to use

_NOTE: Currently may be unusable due to the open-source version of tsthree not being up-to-date. Would not advise trying to run yourself yet._

1. Clone the repository somewhere
1. Run `npm install` in the cloned directory
1. Edit `Localizations.ts` and `ALIEN_CONFIG` (in `Sevastapol.ts`) to change contents
1. (optional) Edit `Icons` spritesheet to change the icons present in portrait mode
